# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to help Pewlett-Hackard understand how many employees will be retiring (by title), and determine which employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.  The analysis will help prepare PH for the upcoming "silver tsunami" as many current employees reach retirement age.  

## Results

1.	 As evidenced by the retiring_titles.png file within the data folder, it is clear that Pewlett-Hackard needs to plan on replacing a large number of employees, many of whom hold senior and engineering roles.  A mentorship program would be a great start toward planning for the “silver tsunami”.  
2.	There are over 1,500 candidates that are eligible for the mentorship program.  By acting now, Pewlett-Hackard can initiate a program with these employees to help prepare for the mass retirement. 
3.	Although the mentorship program will help, the volume of retiring employees will be virtually impossible to replace.  Pewlett-Hackard will need to come up with a plan to become leaner in the future.  Recommendations include remote work, outsourcing sales/engineering jobs, and eliminating any redundant positions. 
4.	Offering a consulting package to the senior level retirees could help with the transition after the “silver tsunami”.  Many retirees take on part time work once their career is over, and by offering a consulting position to these employees, Pewlett-Hackard could strategically be able to navigate the mass retirement.  

## Summary
After writing code to determine how many roles will need to be filled, and to see if there are enough qualified retirement-ready employees there are to mentor the next generation, the following was found.  

1.	 There are 90,398 roles to fill once the “silver tsunami” takes effect.  Of these roles, 5628 are customer service positions.  This is a great opportunity to get lean and outsource the roles to focus on mentoring the more specialized leadership positions.     
2.	Based on a query of senior staff and managers, there is an abundance of employees that would make good mentors for the future generation.  The query I ran for the management and senior level employees produced over 60,000 qualified individuals.  These individuals should be able to help train and retain current and future talent.
